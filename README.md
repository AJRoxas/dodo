# Dodo

Thanks for visiting!

Dodo is a personalized academic platform that makes it effortless to track grades. It allows you to record assessments, monitor course progress, and set academic goals - all in one place. The reality is that sometimes thinking about your academic performance can make you feel a little stressed, especially when you can't gauge how well you're doing. But, grades can get messy and overwhelming ‚Äî often requiring multiple spreadsheets, manual formulas and calculations, and endless adjustments.

With Dodo, this process is automated for you, giving you insights into your grades and performance, all without the frustration of using spreadsheets. By visualizing your progress and setting clear goals, you can stay organized, motivated, and stress-free throughout the semester, and be in full control of your academic journey!

It's currently not ready yet, but I hope you try it when it is!
